Because my $job's environment is still stuck on version 2015.5.10, I'm only providing the XML's here. 

"You could always go to a new version..." I'm perfectly aware of this. However, saltstack's yum repo overwrites EPEL and base packages. So no. Until they provide compatibility for the older python modules, we're stuck.
